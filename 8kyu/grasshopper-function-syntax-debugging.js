// DESCRIPTION:
// Grasshopper - Function syntax debugging
// A student was working on a function and made some syntax mistakes while coding. Help them find their mistakes and fix them.

//My solution
//function starts off as this
// function main [verb, noun]
//   return verb + noun
// }
//in order for the function to run it needed to have this syntax
function main (verb, noun){
  return verb + noun
}
